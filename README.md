# rnn: recurrent neural networks #

This is a Recurrent Neural Network library that extends Torch's nn. 
You can use it to build RNNs, LSTMs, BRNNs, BLSTMs, and so forth and so on.
This library includes documentation for the following objects:

 * [AbstractRecurrent](#rnn.AbstractRecurrent) : an abstract class inherited by Recurrent and LSTM;
 * [Recurrent](#rnn.Recurrent) : a generalized recurrent neural network container;
 * [LSTM](#rnn.LSTM) : a vanilla Long-Short Term Memory module;
  * [FastLSTM](#rnn.FastLSTM) : a faster [LSTM](#rnn.LSTM);

 * [Recurrence](#rnn.Recurrence) : decorates a module that outputs `output(t)` given `{input(t), output(t-1)}`;

Modules that `forward` entire sequences through a decorated `AbstractRecurrent` instance :

<a name='rnn.AbstractRecurrent'></a>
## AbstractRecurrent ##
An abstract class inherited by [Recurrent](#rnn.Recurrent) and [LSTM](#rnn.LSTM).
The constructor takes a single argument :
```lua
rnn = nn.AbstractRecurrent(rho)
```
Argument `rho` is the maximum number of steps to backpropagate through time (BPTT).
Sub-classes can set this to a large number like 99999 if they want to backpropagate through 
the entire sequence whatever its length. Setting lower values of rho are 
useful when long sequences are forward propagated, but we only whish to 
backpropagate through the last `rho` steps, which means that the remainder 
of the sequence doesn't need to be stored (so no additional cost). 

### [recurrentModule] getStepModule(step) ###
Returns a module for time-step `step`. This is used internally by sub-classes 
to obtain copies of the internal `recurrentModule`. These copies share 
`parameters` and `gradParameters` but each have their own `output`, `gradInput` 
and any other intermediate states. 

### maskZero(nInputDim) ###
Decorates the internal `recurrentModule` with [MaskZero](#rnn.MaskZero). 
The `output` Tensor (or table thereof) of the `recurrentModule`
will have each row (samples) zeroed when the commensurate row of the `input` 
is a tensor of zeros. 

The `nInputDim` argument must specify the number of non-batch dims 
in the first Tensor of the `input`. In the case of an `input` table,
the first Tensor is the first one encountered when doing a depth-first search.

Calling this method makes it possible to pad sequences with different lengths in the same batch with zero vectors.
Warning: padding must come before any real data in the input sequence (padding
after the real data is not supported and will yield unpredictable results without failing).

### [output] updateOutput(input) ###
Forward propagates the input for the current step. The outputs or intermediate 
states of the previous steps are used recurrently. This is transparent to the 
caller as the previous outputs and intermediate states are memorized. This 
method also increments the `step` attribute by 1.

### updateGradInput(input, gradOutput) ###
It is important to understand that the actual BPTT happens in the `updateParameters`, 
`backwardThroughTime` or `backwardUpdateThroughTime` methods. So this 
method just keeps a copy of the `gradOutput`. These are stored in a 
table in the order that they were provided.

### accGradParameters(input, gradOutput, scale) ###
Again, the actual BPTT happens in the `updateParameters`, 
`backwardThroughTime` or `backwardUpdateThroughTime` methods.
So this method just keeps a copy of the `scales` for later.

<a name='rnn.AbstractRecurrent.backwardThroughTime'></a>
### backwardThroughTime([step, rho]) ###
This method calls `updateGradInputThroughTime` followed by `accGradParametersThroughTime`.
This is where the actual BPTT happens. 

Argument `step` specifies that the BPTT should only happen 
starting from time-step `step` (which defaults to `self.step`, i.e. the current time-step).
Argument `rho` specifies for how many time-steps the BPTT should happen 
(which defaults to `self.rho`). 
For example, supposing we called `updageOutput` 5 times (so `self.step=6`), 
if we want to backpropagate through step 5 only, we can call :

```lua
rnn:backwardThroughTime(6, 1)
```

### updateGradInputThroughTime([step, rho]) ###
Iteratively calls `updateGradInput` for all time-steps in reverse order 
(from the end to the start of the sequence). Returns the `gradInput` of 
the first time-step.

See [backwardThroughTime](#rnn.AbstractRecurrent.backwardThroughTime) for an 
explanation of optional arguments `step` and `rho`.

### accGradParametersThroughTime([step, rho]) ###
Iteratively calls `accGradParameters` for all time-steps in reverse order 
(from the end to the start of the sequence). 

See [backwardThroughTime](#rnn.AbstractRecurrent.backwardThroughTime) for an 
explanation of optional arguments `step` and `rho`.

### accUpdateGradParametersThroughTime(learningRate) ###
Iteratively calls `accUpdateGradParameters` for all time-steps in reverse order 
(from the end to the start of the sequence). 

### backwardUpdateThroughTime(learningRate) ###
This method calls `updateGradInputThroughTime` and 
`accUpdateGradParametersThroughTime(learningRate)` and returns the `gradInput` 
of the first step. 

### updateParameters(learningRate) ###
Unless `backwardThroughTime` or `accGradParameters` where called since
the last call to `updateOutput`, `backwardUpdateThroughTime` is called.
Otherwise, it calls `updateParameters` on all encapsulated Modules.

### recycle(offset) ###
This method goes hand in hand with `forget`. It is useful when the current
time-step is greater than `rho`, at which point it starts recycling 
the oldest `recurrentModule` `sharedClones`, 
such that they can be reused for storing the next step. This `offset` 
is used for modules like `nn.Recurrent` that use a different module 
for the first step. Default offset is 0.

<a name='rnn.AbstractRecurrent.forget'></a>
### forget(offset) ###
This method brings back all states to the start of the sequence buffers, 
i.e. it forgets the current sequence. It also resets the `step` attribute to 1.
It is highly recommended to call `forget` after each parameter update. 
Otherwise, the previous state will be used to activate the next, which 
will often lead to instability. This is caused by the previous state being
the result of now changed parameters. It is also good practice to call 
`forget` at the start of each new sequence.

<a name='rnn.AbstractRecurrent.maxBPTTstep'></a>
###  maxBPTTstep(rho) ###
This method sets the maximum number of time-steps for which to perform 
backpropagation through time (BPTT). So say you set this to `rho = 3` time-steps,
feed-forward for 4 steps, and then backpropgate, only the last 3 steps will be 
used for the backpropagation. If your AbstractRecurrent instance is wrapped 
by a [Sequencer](#rnn.Sequencer), this will be handled auto-magically by the Sequencer.
Otherwise, setting this value to a large value (i.e. 9999999), is good for most, if not all, cases.

<a name='rnn.AbstractRecurrent.backwardOnline'></a>
### backwardOnline([online]) ###
Call this method with `online=true` (the default) to make calls to 
`backward` (including `updateGradInput` and `accGradParameters`) 
perform backpropagation through time. This requires that calls to 
these `backward` methods be performed in the opposite order of the 
`forward` calls.

So for example, given the following data and `rnn` :
```lua
-- backpropagate every 5 time steps
rho = 5

-- generate some dummy inputs and gradOutputs sequences
inputs, gradOutputs = {}, {}
for step=1,rho do
   inputs[step] = torch.randn(3,10)
   gradOutputs[step] = torch.randn(3,10)
end

-- an AbstractRecurrent instance
rnn = nn.LSTM(10,10)
```

We could feed-forward and backpropagate through time like this :

```lua
for step=1,rho do
   rnn:forward(inputs[step])
   rnn:backward(inputs[step], gradOutputs[step])
end
rnn:backwardThroughTime()
rnn:updateParameters(0.1)
rnn:forget()
```

In the above example, each call to `backward` only saves the sequence of 
`gradOutput` Tensors. It is the call to `backwardThroughTime()` that 
actually does the backpropagation through time.

Alternatively, we could backpropagate through time *online*.
To do so, we need to activate this feature by calling the `backwardOnline` method
(once, at the start of training). Then we will make calls to `backward` in 
reverse order of the calls to `forward`. Each such call will backpropagate 
through a time-step, begining at the last time-step, ending at the first.
So the above example can be implemented like this instead :

```lua
rnn:backwardOnline()
-- forward
for step=1,rho do
   rnn:forward(inputs[step])
end

-- backward (in reverse order of forward calls)
gradInputs = {}
for step=rho,1,-1 do
   gradInputs[step] = rnn:backward(inputs[step], gradOutputs[step])
end

rnn:updateParameters(0.1)
rnn:forget()
```

Also notice that `backwardOnline` makes the calls to `backward` generate 
a `gradInput` for every time-step. Whereas without this, these 
would only be made available via the `rnn.gradInputs` table after the 
call to `backwardThroughTime()`.


### training() ###
In training mode, the network remembers all previous `rho` (number of time-steps)
states. This is necessary for BPTT. 

### evaluate() ###
During evaluation, since their is no need to perform BPTT at a later time, 
only the previous step is remembered. This is very efficient memory-wise, 
such that evaluation can be performed using potentially infinite-length 
sequence.

A [composite Module](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/containers.md#containers) for implementing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), excluding the output layer. 

The `nn.Recurrent(start, input, feedback, [transfer, rho, merge])` constructor takes 5 arguments:
 * `start` : the size of the output (excluding the batch dimension), or a Module that will be inserted between the `input` Module and `transfer` module during the first step of the propagation. When `start` is a size (a number or `torch.LongTensor`), then this *start* Module will be initialized as `nn.Add(start)` (see Ref. A).
 * `input` : a Module that processes input Tensors (or Tables). Output must be of same size as `start` (or its output in the case of a `start` Module), and same size as the output of the `feedback` Module.
 * `feedback` : a Module that feedbacks the previous output Tensor (or Tables) up to the `transfer` Module.
 * `transfer` : a non-linear Module used to process the element-wise sum of the `input` and `feedback` module outputs, or in the case of the first step, the output of the *start* Module.
 * `rho` : the maximum amount of backpropagation steps to take back in time. Limits the number of previous steps kept in memory. Due to the vanishing gradients effect, references A and B recommend `rho = 5` (or lower). Defaults to 5.
 * `merge` : a [table Module](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/table.md#table-layers) that merges the outputs of the `input` and `feedback` Module before being forwarded through the `transfer` Module.
 
An RNN is used to process a sequence of inputs. 
Each step in the sequence should be propagated by its own `forward` (and `backward`), 
one `input` (and `gradOutput`) at a time. 
Each call to `forward` keeps a log of the intermediate states (the `input` and many `Module.outputs`) 
and increments the `step` attribute by 1. 
A call to `backward` doesn't result in a `gradInput`. It only keeps a log of the current `gradOutput` and `scale`.
Back-Propagation Through Time (BPTT) is done when the `updateParameters` or `backwardThroughTime` method
is called. The `step` attribute is only reset to 1 when a call to the `forget` method is made. 
In which case, the Module is ready to process the next sequence (or batch thereof).
Note that the longer the sequence, the more memory will be required to store all the 
`output` and `gradInput` states (one for each time step). 

To use this module with batches, we suggest using different 
sequences of the same size within a batch and calling `updateParameters` 
every `rho` steps and `forget` at the end of the Sequence. 

Note that calling the `evaluate` method turns off long-term memory; 
the RNN will only remember the previous output. This allows the RNN 
to handle long sequences without allocating any additional memory.

Example :
```lua
require 'rnn'

batchSize = 8
rho = 5
hiddenSize = 10
nIndex = 10000
-- RNN
r = nn.Recurrent(
   hiddenSize, nn.LookupTable(nIndex, hiddenSize), 
   nn.Linear(hiddenSize, hiddenSize), nn.Sigmoid(), 
   rho
)

rnn = nn.Sequential()
rnn:add(r)
rnn:add(nn.Linear(hiddenSize, nIndex))
rnn:add(nn.LogSoftMax())

criterion = nn.ClassNLLCriterion()

-- dummy dataset (task is to predict next item, given previous)
sequence = torch.randperm(nIndex)

offsets = {}
for i=1,batchSize do
   table.insert(offsets, math.ceil(math.random()*batchSize))
end
offsets = torch.LongTensor(offsets)

lr = 0.1
updateInterval = 4
i = 1
while true do
   -- a batch of inputs
   local input = sequence:index(1, offsets)
   local output = rnn:forward(input)
   -- incement indices
   offsets:add(1)
   for j=1,batchSize do
      if offsets[j] > nIndex then
         offsets[j] = 1
      end
   end
   local target = sequence:index(1, offsets)
   local err = criterion:forward(output, target)
   print(err)
   local gradOutput = criterion:backward(output, target)
   -- the Recurrent layer is memorizing its gradOutputs (up to memSize)
   rnn:backward(input, gradOutput)
   
   i = i + 1
   -- note that updateInterval < rho
   if i % updateInterval == 0 then
      -- backpropagates through time (BPTT) :
      -- 1. backward through feedback and input layers,
      rnn:backwardThroughTime()
      -- 2. updates parameters
      rnn:updateParameters(lr)
      rnn:zeroGradParameters()
      -- 3. reset the internal time-step counter
      rnn:forget()
   end
end
```

Another option, is to perform the backpropagation through time using 
the normal Module interface. The only requirement is that you 
wrap your rnn into a [Recursor](#rnn.Recursor) and
call `backwardOnline()` and then call `backward` 
in reverse order of the `forward` calls:

```lua
rnn = nn.Recursor(rnn, rho)
rnn:backwardOnline()

i=1
inputs, outputs, targets = {}, {}
while true do
   -- a batch of inputs
   local input = sequence:index(1, offsets)
   local output = rnn:forward(input)
   -- incement indices
   offsets:add(1)
   for j=1,batchSize do
      if offsets[j] > nIndex then
         offsets[j] = 1
      end
   end
   local target = sequence:index(1, offsets)
   local err = criterion:forward(output, target)
   
   -- save these for the BPTT
   table.insert(inputs, input)
   table.insert(outputs, output)
   table.insert(targets, target)
   
   i = i + 1
   -- note that updateInterval < rho
   if i % updateInterval == 0 then
      for step=updateInterval,1,-1 do
         local gradOutput = criterion:backward(outputs[step], targets[step])
         rnn:backward(inputs[step], gradOutput)
      end
      rnn:updateParameters(lr)
      rnn:zeroGradParameters()
      
      inputs, outputs, targets = {}, {}, {}
   end
end
```

This is basically what a `Sequencer` does internally.

<a name='rnn.Recurrent.Sequencer'></a>
### Decorate it with a Sequencer ###

Note that any `AbstractRecurrent` instance can be decorated with a [Sequencer](#rnn.Sequencer) 
such that an entire sequence (a table) can be presented with a single `forward/backward` call.
This is actually the recommended approach as it allows RNNs to be stacked and makes the 
rnn conform to the Module interface, i.e. a `forward`, `backward` and `updateParameters` are all 
that is required ( `Sequencer` handles the `backwardThroughTime` internally ).

```lua
seq = nn.Sequencer(module)
```

The following example is similar to the previous one, except that 
 
  * `updateInterval=rho` (a `Sequencer` constraint);
  * the mean of the previous `rho` errors `err` is printed every `rho` time-steps (instead of printing the `err` of every time-step); and
  * the model uses `Sequencers` to decorate each module such that `rho=5` time-steps can be `forward`,`backward` and updated for each batch (i.e. training loop):

```lua
require 'rnn'

batchSize = 8
rho = 5
hiddenSize = 10
nIndex = 10000

mlp = nn.Sequential()
   :add(nn.Recurrent(
      hiddenSize, nn.LookupTable(nIndex, hiddenSize), 
      nn.Linear(hiddenSize, hiddenSize), nn.Sigmoid(), 
      rho
   )
   :add(nn.Linear(hiddenSize, nIndex))
   :add(nn.LogSoftMax())

rnn = nn.Sequencer(mlp)

criterion = nn.SequencerCriterion(nn.ClassNLLCriterion())

-- dummy dataset (task is to predict next item, given previous)
sequence = torch.randperm(nIndex)

offsets = {}
for i=1,batchSize do
   table.insert(offsets, math.ceil(math.random()*batchSize))
end
offsets = torch.LongTensor(offsets)

lr = 0.1
i = 1
while true do
   -- prepare inputs and targets
   local inputs, targets = {},{}
   for step=1,rho do
      -- a batch of inputs
      table.insert(inputs, sequence:index(1, offsets))
      -- incement indices
      offsets:add(1)
      for j=1,batchSize do
         if offsets[j] > nIndex then
            offsets[j] = 1
         end
      end
      -- a batch of targets
      table.insert(targets, sequence:index(1, offsets))
   end
   
   local outputs = rnn:forward(inputs)
   local err = criterion:forward(outputs, targets)
   print(i, err/rho)
   i = i + 1
   local gradOutputs = criterion:backward(outputs, targets)
   rnn:backward(inputs, gradOutputs)
   rnn:updateParameters(lr)
   rnn:zeroGradParameters()
end
```

You should only think about using the `AbstractRecurrent` modules without 
a `Sequencer` if you intend to use it for real-time prediction. 
Actually, you can even use an `AbstractRecurrent` instance decorated by a `Sequencer`
for real time prediction by calling `Sequencer:remember()` and presenting each 
time-step `input` as `{input}`.

Other decorators can be used such as the [Repeater](#rnn.Repeater) or [RecurrentAttention](#rnn.RecurrentAttention).
The `Sequencer` is only the most common one. 

<a name='rnn.LSTM'></a>
## LSTM ##
References :
 * A. [Speech Recognition with Deep Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.5778v1.pdf)
 * B. [Long-Short Term Memory](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~itamar/courses/ECE-692/Bobby_paper1.pdf)
 * C. [LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04069v1.pdf)
 * D. [nngraph LSTM implementation on github](https://github.com/wojzaremba/lstm)

This is an implementation of a vanilla Long-Short Term Memory module. 
We used Ref. A's LSTM as a blueprint for this module as it was the most concise.
Yet it is also the vanilla LSTM described in Ref. C. 

The `nn.LSTM(inputSize, outputSize, [rho])` constructor takes 3 arguments:
 * `inputSize` : a number specifying the size of the input;
 * `outputSize` : a number specifying the size of the output;
 * `rho` : the maximum amount of backpropagation steps to take back in time. Limits the number of previous steps kept in memory. Defaults to 9999.

![LSTM](doc/image/LSTM.png) 

The actual implementation corresponds to the following algorithm:
```lua
i[t] = σ(W[x->i]x[t] + W[h->i]h[t−1] + W[c->i]c[t−1] + b[1->i])      (1)
f[t] = σ(W[x->f]x[t] + W[h->f]h[t−1] + W[c->f]c[t−1] + b[1->f])      (2)
z[t] = tanh(W[x->c]x[t] + W[h->c]h[t−1] + b[1->c])                   (3)
c[t] = f[t]c[t−1] + i[t]z(t)                                         (4)
o[t] = σ(W[x->o]x[t] + W[h->o]h[t−1] + W[c->o]c[t] + b[1->o])        (5)
h[t] = o[t]tanh(c[t])                                                (6)
```
where `W[s->q]` is the weight matrix from `s` to `q`, `t` indexes the time-step,
`b[1->q]` are the biases leading into `q`, `σ()` is `Sigmoid`, `x[t]` is the input,
`i[t]` is the input gate (eq. 1), `f[t]` is the forget gate (eq. 2), 
`z[t]` is the input to the cell (which we call the hidden) (eq. 3), 
`c[t]` is the cell (eq. 4), `o[t]` is the output gate (eq. 5), 
and `h[t]` is the output of this module (eq. 6). Also note that the 
weight matrices from cell to gate vectors are diagonal `W[c->s]`, where `s` 
is `i`,`f`, or `o`.

As you can see, unlike [Recurrent](#rnn.Recurrent), this 
implementation isn't generic enough that it can take arbitrary component Module
definitions at construction. However, the LSTM module can easily be adapted 
through inheritance by overriding the different factory methods :
  * `buildGate` : builds generic gate that is used to implement the input, forget and output gates;
  * `buildInputGate` : builds the input gate (eq. 1). Currently calls `buildGate`;
  * `buildForgetGate` : builds the forget gate (eq. 2). Currently calls `buildGate`;
  * `buildHidden` : builds the hidden (eq. 3);
  * `buildCell` : builds the cell (eq. 4);
  * `buildOutputGate` : builds the output gate (eq. 5). Currently calls `buildGate`;
  * `buildModel` : builds the actual LSTM model which is used internally (eq. 6).
  
Note that we recommend decorating the `LSTM` with a `Sequencer` 
(refer to [this](#rnn.Recurrent.Sequencer) for details).
  
<a name='rnn.FastLSTM'></a>
## FastLSTM ##

A faster version of the [LSTM](#rnn.LSTM). 
Basically, the input, forget and output gates, as well as the hidden state are computed at one fell swoop.

<a name='rnn.Recursor'></a>
## Recursor ##

This module recorates a `module` to be used within an `AbstractSequencer` instance.
It does this by making the decorated module conform to the `AbstractRecurrent` interface,
which like the `LSTM` and `Recurrent` classes, this class inherits. 

```lua
rec = nn.Recursor(module[, rho])
```

For each successive call to `updateOutput` (i.e. `forward`), this 
decorator will create a `stepClone()` of the decorated `module`. 
So for each time-step, it clones the `module`. Both the clone and 
original share parameters and gradients w.r.t. parameters. However, for 
modules that already conform to the `AbstractRecurrent` interface, 
the clone and original module are one in the same (i.e. no clone).

Examples :

Let's assume I want to stack two LSTMs. I could use two sequencers :

```lua
lstm = nn.Sequential()
   :add(nn.Sequencer(nn.LSTM(100,100)))
   :add(nn.Sequencer(nn.LSTM(100,100)))
```

Using a `Recursor`, I make the same model with a single `Sequencer` :

```lua
lstm = nn.Sequencer(
   nn.Recursor(
      nn.Sequential()
         :add(nn.LSTM(100,100))
         :add(nn.LSTM(100,100))
      )
   )
```

Actually, the `Sequencer` will wrap any non-`AbstractRecurrent` module automatically, 
so I could simplify this further to :

```lua
lstm = nn.Sequencer(
   nn.Sequential()
      :add(nn.LSTM(100,100))
      :add(nn.LSTM(100,100))
   )
```

I can also add a `Linear` between the two `LSTM`s. In this case,
a `Linear` will be cloned (and have its parameters shared) for each time-step,
while the `LSTM`s will do whatever cloning internally :

```lua
lstm = nn.Sequencer(
   nn.Sequential()
      :add(nn.LSTM(100,100))
      :add(nn.Linear(100,100))
      :add(nn.LSTM(100,100))
   )
```

`AbstractRecurrent` instances like `Recursor`, `Recurrent` and `LSTM` are 
expcted to manage time-steps internally. Non-`AbstractRecurrent` instances
can be wrapped by a `Recursor` to have the same behavior. 

Every call to `forward` on an `AbstractRecurrent` instance like `Recursor` 
will increment the `self.step` attribute by 1, using a shared parameter clone
for each successive time-step (for a maximum of `rho` time-steps, which defaults to 9999999).
In this way, with the help of [backwardOnline](#rnn.AbstractRecurrent.backwardOnline) 
we can then call `backward` in reverse order of the `forward` calls 
to perform backpropagation through time (BPTT). Which is exactly what 
[AbstractSequencer](#rnn.AbstractSequencer) instances do internally.
The `backward` call, which is actually divided into calls to `updateGradInput` and 
`accGradParameters`, decrements by 1 the `self.udpateGradInputStep` and `self.accGradParametersStep`
respectively, starting at `self.step`.
Successive calls to `backward` will decrement these counters and use them to 
backpropagate through the appropriate internall step-wise shared-parameter clones.

Anyway, in most cases, you will not have to deal with the `Recursor` object directly as
`AbstractSequencer` instances automatically decorate non-`AbstractRecurrent` instances
with a `Recursor` in their constructors.

<a name='rnn.Recurrence'></a>
## Recurrence ##

A extremely general container for implementing pretty much any type of recurrence.

```lua
rnn = nn.Recurrence(recurrentModule, outputSize, nInputDim, [rho])
```

Unlike [Recurrent](#rnn.Recurrent), this module doesn't manage a separate 
modules like `inputModule`, `startModule`, `mergeModule` and the like.
Instead, it only manages a single `recurrentModule`, which should 
output a Tensor or table : `output(t)` 
given an input table : `{input(t), output(t-1)}`.
Using a mix of `Recursor` (say, via `Sequencer`) with `Recurrence`, one can implement 
pretty much any type of recurrent neural network, including LSTMs and RNNs.

For the first step, the `Recurrence` forwards a Tensor (or table thereof)
of zeros through the recurrent layer (like LSTM, unlike Recurrent).
So it needs to know the `outputSize`, which is either a number or 
`torch.LongStorage`, or table thereof. The batch dimension should be 
excluded from the `outputSize`. Instead, the size of the batch dimension 
(i.e. number of samples) will be extrapolated from the `input` using 
the `nInputDim` argument. For example, say that our input is a Tensor of size 
`4 x 3` where `4` is the number of samples, then `nInputDim` should be `1`.
As another example, if our input is a table of table [...] of tensors 
where the first tensor (depth first) is the same as in the previous example,
then our `nInputDim` is also `1`.


As an example, let's use `Sequencer` and `Recurrence` 
to build a Simple RNN for language modeling :

```lua
rho = 5
hiddenSize = 10
outputSize = 5 -- num classes
nIndex = 10000

-- recurrent module
rm = nn.Sequential()
   :add(nn.ParallelTable()
      :add(nn.LookupTable(nIndex, hiddenSize))
      :add(nn.Linear(hiddenSize, hiddenSize)))
   :add(nn.CAddTable())
   :add(nn.Sigmoid())

rnn = nn.Sequencer(
   nn.Sequential()
      :add(nn.Recurrence(rm, hiddenSize, 1))
      :add(nn.Linear(hiddenSize, outputSize))
      :add(nn.LogSoftMax())
)
```

Note : We could very well reimplement the `LSTM` module using the
newer `Recursor` and `Recurrent` modules, but that would mean 
breaking backwards compatibility for existing models saved on disk.

<a name='rnn.AbstractSequencer'></a>
## AbstractSequencer ##
This abastract class implements a light interface shared by 
subclasses like : `Sequencer`, `Repeater`, `RecurrentAttention`, `BiSequencer` and so on.

  
<a name='rnn.Sequencer'></a>
## Sequencer ##

The `nn.Sequencer(module)` constructor takes a single argument, `module`, which is the module 
to be applied from left to right, on each element of the input sequence.

```lua
seq = nn.Sequencer(module)
```

This Module is a kind of [decorator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) 
used to abstract away the intricacies of `AbstractRecurrent` modules. While an `AbstractRecurrent` instance 
requires that a sequence to be presented one input at a time, each with its own call to `forward` (and `backward`),
the `Sequencer` forwards an `input` sequence (a table) into an `output` sequence (a table of the same length).
It also takes care of calling `forget`, `backwardOnline` and other such AbstractRecurrent-specific methods.

For example, `rnn` : an instance of nn.AbstractRecurrent, can forward an `input` sequence one forward at a time:
```lua
input = {torch.randn(3,4), torch.randn(3,4), torch.randn(3,4)}
rnn:forward(input[1])
rnn:forward(input[2])
rnn:forward(input[3])
```

Equivalently, we can use a Sequencer to forward the entire `input` sequence at once:

```lua
seq = nn.Sequencer(rnn)
seq:forward(input)
```

The `Sequencer` can also take non-recurrent Modules (i.e. non-AbstractRecurrent instances) and apply it to each 
input to produce an output table of the same length. 
This is especially useful for processing variable length sequences (tables).

Internally, the `Sequencer` expects the decorated `module` to be an 
`AbstractRecurrent` instance. When this is not the case, the `module` 
is automatically decorated with a [Recursor](#rnn.Recursor) module, which makes it 
conform to the `AbstractRecurrent` interface. 

Note : this is due a recent update (27 Oct 2015), as before this 
`AbstractRecurrent` and and non-`AbstractRecurrent` instances needed to 
be decorated by their own `Sequencer`. The recent update, which introduced the 
`Recursor` decorator, allows a single `Sequencer` to wrap any type of module, 
`AbstractRecurrent`, non-`AbstractRecurrent` or a composite structure of both types.
Nevertheless, existing code shouldn't be affected by the change.

### remember([mode]) ###
When `mode='both'`, the Sequencer will not call [forget](#nn.AbstractRecurrent.forget) at the start of 
each call to `forward`, which is the default behavior of the class. 
This behavior is only applicable to decorated AbstractRecurrent `modules`.
Accepted values for argument `mode` are as follows :

 * 'eval' only affects evaluation (recommended for RNNs)
 * 'train' only affects training
 * 'neither' affects neither training nor evaluation (default behavior of the class)
 * 'both' affects both training and evaluation (recommended for LSTMs)

### forget() ###
Calls the decorated AbstractRecurrent module's `forget` method.

<a name='rnn.BiSequencer'></a>
## BiSequencer ##
Applies encapsulated `fwd` and `bwd` rnns to an input sequence in forward and reverse order.
It is used for implementing Bidirectional RNNs and LSTMs.

```lua
brnn = nn.BiSequencer(fwd, [bwd, merge])
```

The input to the module is a sequence (a table) of tensors
and the output is a sequence (a table) of tensors of the same length.
Applies a `fwd` rnn (an [AbstractRecurrent](#rnn.AbstractRecurrent) instance to each element in the sequence in
forward order and applies the `bwd` rnn in reverse order (from last element to first element).
The `bwd` rnn defaults to:

```lua
bwd = fwd:clone()
bwd:reset()
```

For each step (in the original sequence), the outputs of both rnns are merged together using
the `merge` module (defaults to `nn.JoinTable(1,1)`). 
If `merge` is a number, it specifies the [JoinTable](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/table.md#nn.JoinTable)
constructor's `nInputDim` argument. Such that the `merge` module is then initialized as :

```lua
merge = nn.JoinTable(1,merge)
```

Internally, the `BiSequencer` is implemented by decorating a structure of modules that makes 
use of 3 Sequencers for the forward, backward and merge modules.

Similarly to a [Sequencer](#rnn.Sequencer), the sequences in a batch must have the same size.
But the sequence length of each batch can vary.

<a name='rnn.BiSequencerLM'></a>
## BiSequencerLM ##

Applies encapsulated `fwd` and `bwd` rnns to an input sequence in forward and reverse order.
It is used for implementing Bidirectional RNNs and LSTMs for Language Models (LM).

```lua
brnn = nn.BiSequencerLM(fwd, [bwd, merge])
```

The input to the module is a sequence (a table) of tensors
and the output is a sequence (a table) of tensors of the same length.
Applies a `fwd` rnn (an [AbstractRecurrent](#rnn.AbstractRecurrent) instance to the 
first `N-1` elements in the sequence in forward order.
Applies the `bwd` rnn in reverse order to the last `N-1` elements (from second-to-last element to first element).
This is the main difference of this module with the [BiSequencer](#rnn.BiSequencer).
The latter cannot be used for language modeling because the `bwd` rnn would be trained to predict the input it had just be fed as input.

![BiDirectionalLM](doc/image/bidirectionallm.png)

The `bwd` rnn defaults to:

```lua
bwd = fwd:clone()
bwd:reset()
```

While the `fwd` rnn will output representations for the last `N-1` steps,
the `bwd` rnn will output representations for the first `N-1` steps.
The missing outputs for each rnn ( the first step for the `fwd`, the last step for the `bwd`)
will be filled with zero Tensors of the same size the commensure rnn's outputs.
This way they can be merged. If `nn.JoinTable` is used (the default), then the first 
and last output elements will be padded with zeros for the missing `fwd` and `bwd` rnn outputs, respectively.

For each step (in the original sequence), the outputs of both rnns are merged together using
the `merge` module (defaults to `nn.JoinTable(1,1)`). 
If `merge` is a number, it specifies the [JoinTable](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/table.md#nn.JoinTable)
constructor's `nInputDim` argument. Such that the `merge` module is then initialized as :

```lua
merge = nn.JoinTable(1,merge)
```

Similarly to a [Sequencer](#rnn.Sequencer), the sequences in a batch must have the same size.
But the sequence length of each batch can vary.

Note that LMs implemented with this module will not be classical LMs as they won't measure the 
probability of a word given the previous words. Instead, they measure the probabiliy of a word
given the surrounding words, i.e. context. While for mathematical reasons you may not be able to use this to measure the 
probability of a sequence of words (like a sentence), 
you can still measure the pseudo-likeliness of such a sequence (see [this](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.01575.pdf) for a discussion).

<a name='rnn.Repeater'></a>
## Repeater ##
This Module is a [decorator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) similar to [Sequencer].
It differs in that the sequence length is fixed before hand and the input is repeatedly forwarded 
through the wrapped `module` to produce an output table of length `nStep`:
```lua
r = nn.Repeater(module, nStep)
```
Argument `module` should be an `AbstractRecurrent` instance.
This is useful for implementing models like [RCNNs](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/pinheiro14.pdf),
which are repeatedly presented with the same input.

<a name='rnn.RecurrentAttention'></a>
## RecurrentAttention ##
References :
  
  * A. [Recurrent Models of Visual Attention](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5542-recurrent-models-of-visual-attention.pdf)
  * B. [Simple Statistical Gradient-Following Algorithms for Connectionist Reinforcement Learning](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/williams-92.pdf)
  
This module can be used to implement the Recurrent Attention Model (RAM) presented in Ref. A :
```lua
ram = nn.RecurrentAttention(rnn, action, nStep, hiddenSize)
```

`rnn` is an [AbstractRecurrent](#rnn.AbstractRecurrent) instance. 
Its input is `{x, z}` where `x` is the input to the `ram` and `z` is an 
action sampled from the `action` module. 
The output size of the `rnn` must be equal to `hiddenSize`.

`action` is a [Module](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/module.md#nn.Module) 
that uses a [REINFORCE module](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dpnn#nn.Reinforce) (ref. B) like 
[ReinforceNormal](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dpnn#nn.ReinforceNormal), 
[ReinforceCategorical](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dpnn#nn.ReinforceCategorical), or 
[ReinforceBernoulli](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dpnn#nn.ReinforceBernoulli) 
to sample actions given the previous time-step's output of the `rnn`. 
During the first time-step, the `action` module is fed with a Tensor of zeros of size `input:size(1) x hiddenSize`.
It is important to understand that the sampled actions do not receive gradients 
backpropagated from the training criterion. 
Instead, a reward is broadcast from a Reward Criterion like [VRClassReward](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dpnn#nn.VRClassReward) Criterion to 
the `action`'s REINFORCE module, which will backprogate graidents computed from the `output` samples 
and the `reward`. 
Therefore, the `action` module's outputs are only used internally, within the RecurrentAttention module.

`nStep` is the number of actions to sample, i.e. the number of elements in the `output` table.

`hiddenSize` is the output size of the `rnn`. This variable is necessary 
to generate the zero Tensor to sample an action for the first step (see above).

A complete implementation of Ref. A is available [here](examples/recurrent-visual-attention.lua).

<a name='rnn.MaskZero'></a>
## MaskZero ##
This module zeroes the `output` rows of the decorated module 
for commensurate `input` rows which are tensors of zeros.

```lua
mz = nn.MaskZero(module, nInputDim)
```

The `output` Tensor (or table thereof) of the decorated `module`
will have each row (samples) zeroed when the commensurate row of the `input` 
is a tensor of zeros. 

The `nInputDim` argument must specify the number of non-batch dims 
in the first Tensor of the `input`. In the case of an `input` table,
the first Tensor is the first one encountered when doing a depth-first search.

This decorator makes it possible to pad sequences with different lengths in the same batch with zero vectors.

<a name='rnn.SequencerCriterion'></a>
## SequencerCriterion ##
This Criterion is a [decorator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern):
```lua
c = nn.SequencerCriterion(criterion)
``` 
Both the `input` and `target` are expected to be a sequence (a table). 
For each step in the sequence, the corresponding elements of the input and target tables 
will be applied to the `criterion`.
The output of `forward` is the sum of all individual losses in the sequence.
This is useful when used in conjuction with a [Sequencer](#rnn.Sequencer).

WARNING : assumes that the decorated criterion is stateless, i.e. a `backward` shouldn't need to be preceded by a commensurate `forward`.

<a name='rnn.RepeaterCriterion'></a>
## RepeaterCriterion ##
This Criterion is a [decorator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern):
```lua
c = nn.RepeaterCriterion(criterion)
``` 
The `input` is expected to be a sequence (a table). A single `target` is 
repeatedly applied using the same `criterion` to each element in the `input` sequence.
The output of `forward` is the sum of all individual losses in the sequence.
This is useful for implementing models like [RCNNs](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/pinheiro14.pdf),
which are repeatedly presented with the same target.
